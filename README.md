# blue_tile

To build Blue Tile, you will need to have npm (node package manager) installed.
If you do not have npm installed, you can get it here: https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm
If you do not know if you have npm installed, enter the following at your command line:
'npm --version'
If you have it installed, it will tell you the version of npm you have.

Once you have npm installed, clone this repo. Then, within the top level directory of the repo, enter the following command:
'npm install'
This will download and install all the necessary dependencies.

Once that is completed you can run this application with the following command
